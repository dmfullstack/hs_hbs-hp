- Can track all submissions made
- Can track historic submissions
- Can filter for specific Date period, by a specific Participant(s), for a specific Assessment(s)

## Other salient features
- Platform evaluates the programs in a off-line mode, but provides feedback instantly giving capability to evaluate programming exercises at large scale
- Supports evaluating directly from a Git enabled project
- Evaluates each programming exercise in a isolated environment
- Mass enrollment of students
- Multi-tenancy enabled
- OAuth based sign-in, can support Single-Signon
- Supports grouping/batching of students and maintain visibility according to same
- Supports central Assessment repository access, reducing operational effort for curating assessments
- Supports Horizontal scaling
- Provides external integration via REST APIs, Web-hooks
- Both on premises & cloud deployable
- Can link with a concept-map, hence can semantically verify the exercises
